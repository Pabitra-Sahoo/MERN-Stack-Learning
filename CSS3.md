<h3 align="center">CSS Positioning & Units — Festival Edition 🛕💻</h3>

---

## ✨ Context

Today was **Rath Yatra** in Odisha, and between the celebrations and some downtime, I still carved out time for a focused CSS session.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 📍 CSS `position` Property
- `static` → default flow position
- `relative` → positioned relative to itself
- `absolute` → positioned relative to nearest non-static parent
- `fixed` → positioned relative to the viewport (stays on scroll)
- `sticky` → behaves like `relative` until scroll hits a threshold

### 📏 CSS Units
- `px` → fixed size; pixel perfect control  
- `%` → relative to parent element  
- `em` → relative to font-size of parent  
- `rem` → relative to root `html` element  
Learned when to prefer each for **responsiveness and scalability**

## 🧭 Reflection

Understanding how positioning and units interact with layouts makes styling feel much more intentional.  
Even a short session can unlock better habits and future flexibility.

---

## 🔜 What’s Next?

- Practice positioning with real UI examples  
- Dive into **flexbox** for layout control  
- Maybe even build a tiny responsive card layout 🎴
