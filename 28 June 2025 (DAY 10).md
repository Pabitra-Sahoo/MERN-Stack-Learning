<h3 align="center">Float & Overflow – A Light but Consistent Day</h3>

---

## 🌥️ Overview

Today was a low-energy day, and I couldn’t dive deep into learning.  
But I still explored two important layout properties in CSS: `float` and `overflow`.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🧊 `float`
- Used to position elements to the left or right within a container
- Commonly used for wrapping text around images
- Requires clearfix techniques to handle layout issues

### 🌊 `overflow`
- Controls what happens when content exceeds its container
- Values I explored:
  - `visible` (default) → content spills out
  - `hidden` → excess content is clipped
  - `scroll` → always shows scrollbars
  - `auto` → adds scrollbars only when needed

---

## 🧭 Reflection

Even though I didn’t cover much, I’m proud I didn’t skip the day entirely.  
Some days are about maintaining the habit more than making huge leaps.

---

## 🔜 What’s Next?

- Practice float-based layouts  
- Start learning **Flexbox** for modern layout control  
- Revisit overflow in real-world UI examples
