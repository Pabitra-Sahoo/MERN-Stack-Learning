## ✨ Day 1 of My MERN Stack Journey!

📘 Learning with @LoveBabbar is such a blast! His explanations make even the trickiest concepts feel crystal clear. Today I focused on the core building blocks of web development 🌐.

### 🧠 Topics I covered:

  🔹 What is the Internet & how it works

  🔹 Client-Server Architecture 🤝

  🔹 OSI Model - the 7-layer dip of networking 😄
  
  🔹 Key protocols that keep the web spinning 🔁

Feeling grateful, pumped, and ready for what’s next! 💪
Let’s keep building, one day at a time
