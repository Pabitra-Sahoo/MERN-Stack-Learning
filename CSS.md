## 🎨 Introduction to CSS

Today I officially stepped into the world of **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** — where we go from structure to style!  
CSS allows me to control how HTML content looks: colors, spacing, layout, fonts, and more.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### ✏️ Types of CSS
- **Inline** – added directly inside HTML tags (not recommended for scalability)
- **Internal** – within a `<style>` tag inside `<head>`
- **External** – via separate `.css` files linked to HTML (💯 best practice)

### 🎯 CSS Selectors
- **Tag selectors** → `p { ... }`
- **Class selectors** → `.title { ... }`
- **ID selectors** → `#main { ... }`
- **Universal selector** → `* { ... }`

### 📦 Box Model (The Core of Layout)
- **Content** – the actual element
- **Padding** – space around the content
- **Border** – edge around the padding
- **Margin** – space outside the border between elements

## 🧭 Reflection

CSS feels like giving life to raw HTML—suddenly, things start to look real.  
Starting simple but powerful: spacing, targeting, and visual structure.
