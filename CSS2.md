<h3 align="center">Display Property & Box-Sizing – Staying Consistent</h3>

## ☁️ Real Talk

Today was tough—I got a bit sidetracked and found myself stuck in distractions.  
But instead of throwing the day away, I reclaimed a small victory: learning **`display`** and **`box-sizing`** in CSS.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 📐 `display` Property
Controls how an element behaves in layout:
- `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `none`
- Used `flex` briefly — getting excited to explore more layout control soon!

### 📦 `box-sizing`
Discovered the difference between:
- `box-sizing: content-box` (default) → padding & border *add* to the width  
- `box-sizing: border-box` → padding & border stay *within* the specified width  
  ✔️ More intuitive for layout control and widely used in modern designs

## 🌱 Reflection

Even though the day didn’t go as planned, I’m learning to show up anyway.  
Consistency > intensity. Every day won’t be perfect—and that’s okay.

## 🔜 Next Up

- Explore layout display types like `flex` and `grid`  
- Deepen CSS fundamentals with positioning and responsive styling  
- Regain my focus and keep showing up
