## 📌 What I Started Today
Today I officially stepped into the world of **HTML**, the backbone of all web pages.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- ✅ **Basic HTML syntax & structure**
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` basics
- ✅ **Semantic tags**: `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`
- ✅ **Structural & formatting elements**: clarity + accessibility
- ✅ **Block vs Inline elements**
  - Block: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`  
  - Inline: `<a>`, `<span>`, `<strong>`
- ✅ **Emmet in VS Code**
  - Used `!` + `Tab` to create boilerplate HTML  
  - Tried shortcuts like `ul>li*5` → pure speed magic! ⚡

## 🚀 Productivity Boost
> Emmet is a true time-saver in VS Code! Less typing, more building.  
> ✨ It felt like having superpowers right at my fingertips.

## 🔥 Reflections
Starting HTML brought ideas into action—finally writing real code! The satisfaction of seeing my structure take form on screen was unforgettable. Grateful for this momentum.

---

## ⏭️ What’s Next
Up next: HTML **attributes**, **forms**, and diving into **CSS** for styling!  
The foundation is set—time to build upwards. 🏗️
