## ⏳ Context

Today was a bit packed with other responsibilities—but I made sure to stay on track by learning something small but impactful in HTML.

---

## 📌 What I Learned

### 🗂️ Tables in HTML
- Explored how to display data using:
  - `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`
  - Row & column elements: `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`
- Learned to structure data in a readable, organized way

### 📝 Forms & Inputs
- Understood how web forms work using:
  - `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`
- Briefly explored attributes like `action`, `method`, `placeholder`, `required`

## 💡 Reflection

Even with limited time, I felt satisfied checking off a concept or two. Learning tables and forms may seem small—but they power everything from dashboards to login systems!

---

## 🔜 Next Step

Continue practicing more form types and maybe start applying some CSS for styling.  
Let’s keep the rhythm going! 🎵
