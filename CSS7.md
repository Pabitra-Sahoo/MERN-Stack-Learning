<h3 align="center">✅ Flexbox Complete – Grow, Shrink, Wrap & More</h3>

---

## 🚀 Overview

Today I wrapped up the remaining concepts of **CSS Flexbox**.  
It’s been a powerful journey learning how to control layout, spacing, and responsiveness with such precision.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔹 `flex-grow`
- Defines how much a flex item should grow relative to others  
- `flex-grow: 1` → item takes up available space

### 🔸 `flex-shrink`
- Controls how items shrink when space is tight  
- `flex-shrink: 0` → item won’t shrink

### 🔁 `flex-wrap`
- Allows items to wrap onto multiple lines  
- Values: `nowrap` (default), `wrap`, `wrap-reverse`

### 🎯 `align-self`
- Overrides `align-items` for a specific item  
- Useful for custom alignment in mixed layouts

### 🔢 `order`
- Changes the visual order of items without changing HTML  
- Lower numbers appear first

## 🧭 Reflection

Flexbox is incredibly powerful once you understand how each property interacts.  
I now feel confident using it to build responsive, flexible layouts.
