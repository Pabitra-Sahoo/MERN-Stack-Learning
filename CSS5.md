## ðŸ§­ Overview

Today I began exploring **Flexbox**, one of the most powerful layout systems in CSS.  
Although I couldnâ€™t complete the full topic due to distractions, I made progress by understanding how `justify-content` works.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

### ðŸ”¹ Flexbox Basics
- Applied `display: flex` to a container to activate Flexbox
- Understood the concept of main axis vs cross axis

### ðŸ”¸ `justify-content`
- Controls alignment of items along the main axis
- Explored values like:
  - `flex-start`
  - `center`
  - `flex-end`
  - `space-between`
  - `space-around`
  - `space-evenly`

## ðŸ’­ Reflection

Today wasnâ€™t perfect, but I still moved forward.  
Flexbox already feels like a game-changer for layout controlâ€”Iâ€™m excited to dive deeper tomorrow.

## ðŸ”œ Whatâ€™s Next?
