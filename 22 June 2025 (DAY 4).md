## 🔁 What I Focused On

Despite some distractions, I powered through and wrapped up all the **essential concepts of HTML forms**. I also made time to **experiment with multiple form elements** and their behaviors in the browser.

## 🧠 Key Elements Covered

### 🔸 Grouping & Structure
- `<fieldset>` & `<legend>` to group related input fields

### 🔸 Input Variety
- Explored form input types like:
  - `text`, `tel`, `email`, `file`, `image`, `password`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `number`, `date`, `submit`

### 🔸 Dropdown Menus
- Built select menus using:
  - `<select>`, `<option>`  
  - Practiced attributes like `selected`, `disabled`, and `value`

## 🛠️ Practice Highlights

## 🎯 Reflection

I’ve now covered all foundational form topics in HTML—and more importantly, I’ve practiced them hands-on.  
It feels great to understand how to collect, validate, and structure input from users using just HTML!

## 🔜 What’s Next?

Tomorrow I’ll shift gears toward **HTML attributes**, **media embedding**, and start peeking into **CSS** ✨  
Let’s style what we’ve built!
