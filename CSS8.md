## ðŸ”„ Honest Recap

I missed a day due to tiredness and a bit of negligenceâ€”but Iâ€™m back on track today.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

### ðŸ“± Media Queries
- Used to apply styles based on screen size or device type
- Syntax:
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    .container {
      flex-direction: column;
    }
  }
