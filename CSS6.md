<h3 align="center">Flexbox – A Glimpse at align-content</h3>

---

## 🌤️ Overview

Today was a light learning day. I didn’t get much done, but I still managed to explore a small part of Flexbox—specifically the `align-content` property.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔸 `align-content`
- Used to align multiple rows of flex items along the cross axis
- Only works when there’s **extra space** in the container and **multiple lines** (i.e., `flex-wrap: wrap`)
- Values include:
  - `flex-start`
  - `center`
  - `flex-end`
  - `space-between`
  - `space-around`
  - `stretch` (default)

## 💭 Reflection

Didn’t cover much today, but I’m still showing up.  
Even a single property adds to the bigger picture. Tomorrow, I’ll aim to go deeper into Flexbox and layout practice.

---

## 🔜 What’s Next?

- Continue Flexbox: `align-items`, `flex-wrap`, `flex-direction`, `gap`  
- Build a small layout using Flexbox to reinforce everything
